# starwars_minifigs

This is a repository to host the source code of an [R Shiny App](https://rporta.shinyapps.io/starwars_minifigs/) that visualizes the relationship between how much screen time each Star Wars character has versus
how many LEGO minifigures have been created of that character. 

This project was done as part of a summer internship with the [Women's Brick Initiative](https://womensbrickinitiative.com/).
